Toxicology Knowledge Base
=========================

Introduction
------------

The Toxicology Knowledge Base (ToxKB) is an integrated resource of toxicology information. The scripts listed here convert toxicology resources into Linked Data to incorporation into the Bio2RDF project.

Instructions
------------

All scripts were written using the Ruby scripting language and make use of external Ruby libraries. These libraries are listed in the gemfile. Installation of the gemfile is accomplished using bundle in the project directory:

> bundle install

Additional outdated gems may be required to support older scripts. These gems are located in the outdated_gems directory. They can be installed using the rubygems package manager.
