Bio2RDF-scripts
===============
 This Git repository holds all of the RDF converter scripts used to generate Bio2RDF linked data.

Requirements
-------------
The majority of these scripts were created so as to run on Linux servers. Depending on the script you wish to run you will need:

* PHP5
* Perl 6
* Ruby(1.9.3)
* Java 1.5
* Bio2RDF API (available from: https://github.com/micheldumontier/php-lib)

The Bio2RDF API should be installed in the root directory of the project tree (i.e bio2rdf-scripts).

Usage
-----
Each script is run independently. See README files inside each script directory.
