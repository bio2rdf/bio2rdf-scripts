#PDB Bio2RDF parser
This is the Bio2RDF parser for the PDB dataset. The files used for the conversion are the PDBML files.

##Requirements
Make sure that the following software is installed and accessible to your users' PATH:
	1. Sun Java JRE 1.6 or above+
	2. Apache Maven 2.2.0 or above+

##Building
Run the following command to build the following:

	mvn clean install

##Downloading source files
This PDB RDFizer converts PDBML files to Bio2RDF R3 compliant linked data. This RDFizer can be executed on the entire PDB dataset which has to be first downloaded. To download and mirror the entire set of PDB files download and run this [rsync script](https://gist.github.com/jctoledo/6426686). 

##Contents

* **pdb2rdf-cli**:
The command line interface for this parser. Once you have installed the software go to pdb2rdf-cli/target and extract `pdb2rdf-cli-2.0.0-bin.zip`. This file contains `pdb2rdf.sh` an executable shell script that can be used to execute this rdfizer. Here are some example execution types:

    1. Print the help:
       ./pdb2rdf.sh -help
    2. Convert one PDB record given its id and store the output in /tmp/output/:
       ./pdb2rdf.sh -out /tmp/output
    3. Convert all PDB entries found in a given directory:
       ./pdb2rdf.sh -dir /path/to/pdbml/files -out /path/to/outputdir
    4. Generate the output of this RDFizer as N-Quads
       ./pdb2rdf.sh -dir /path/to/pdbml/files -out /path/to/outputdir -format NQUADS;

* **pdb2rdf-parser**:
This module holds the set of classes that convert the PDBML file format to Bio2RDF compliant RDF.

* **pdb2rdf-cluster**:
The cluster edition of this parser. Use this module if you have multiple computers that can be used to simultaneously convert PDBML files into RDF Once you have installed the software go to pdb2rdf-cluster/target and extract `pdb2rdf-cluster-2.0.0-bin.zip`. This file contains `run.sh` an executable shell script that can be used to initialize a PDBML file server onto which other `pdb2rdf.sh` instances can connect to. Here are some example execution types:

    1. Print the help:
	./run.sh
    2. Set the directory where the gzipped PDBML files are located and set the listening port to 8123
	./run.sh -dir /path/to/local/pdbml/direcory -gzip -port 8123
 
Once initialized pdb2rdf.sh clients can connect to the server in the following manner:
	
	./pdb2rdf.sh -cluster 192.168.1.123:8123 -out /tmp/output/directory
