      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The
Pop-In Template
      </p>
      <p><a name="Description"></a>This tab is designed to produce a web
page that displays images of Jmol graphics, each of which can be
converted to a
live Jmol display by the user.&nbsp; This makes initial loading of the
page
faster.&nbsp; The image will match the initial Jmol setup for each occurrence which
is chosen by
setting up the Jmol viewer the way you wish.&nbsp; You add the text
later in your
favorite web editor. This panel can be opened once and returned to
anytime.
An example picture of such a page is shown below:<br>
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 250px; height: 268px;" alt="picture of a pop in web page" src="pop_in.png"><a name="Page_Cartoon"></a></p>
      <p><a name="Instructions"></a><b><i>Instructions</i></b> </p>
      <p>1) Set the relative path to the Jmol applet on you web site from where
you
will put the folder (directory) containing the files created by this
program.&nbsp; (<a href="Path_to_Applet.html">more...</a>)</p>
      <p>2) Put your name(s) in the Author space. This will add you as
the author
in the page meta data that is used for searching.</p>
      <p>3) Add the title you want to appear in the browser window
title bar. This
does not have to be the same as the title you will use for the page.</p>
      <p>4)
If not already done, open the first file you want to appear
in your
page using the File..Open.. menu in the Jmol viewer. If you will be
using
more than one model, open the models one at a time (occasionally you
might need to use "load
append" or the "append models" checkbox to allow displaying more than
one model simultaneously), and follow steps (5) - (7) for each
individual model.</p>
      <p>5) Set the state of the model (zoom, rotate, select, change colors, add
orbitals, set the molecule spinning, etc.) exactly the way you want it
to
appear on the web page.</p>
      <p>6) Set the width and height for the model on this tab. There is no need
to
resize the application window itself.</p>
      <p>7) Click on the "Add Present Jmol State as Instance" button and select
a name
for this applet instance.</p>
      <p>8) Repeat for as many different displays as you wish. Because of the
memory
constraints of web browsers, it is probably best to limit yourself to
no more
than a few instances of Jmol on a single web page. The larger the
applet
size, the more of a problem this will be. However, you can certainly
create a
page with several applets and then split it later into multiple web
pages.</p>
      <p>9) When you are done, click on "Save HTML as..." Provide either the
name of a
new directory for this page or the name of the HTML file (.htm or
.html) you
want to create or replace. All necessary files will be created in the
same
directory. These include the HTML page itself, the JavaScript file
JmolPopin.js, and three files for each view: a data file, a Jmol
script, and
a PNG image. If a new directory is indicated, the HTML file will be
created
in that directory and have the same name, with ".html" appended.</p>
      <p>10) Open the HTML file in your favorite web editor and add your
explanatory
text and anything else you wish.&nbsp; As long as you do not alter the
inside of
the tables where Jmol will be displayed, you should be able to change
the
page without disrupting the JavaScript that controls the behavior of
Jmol. </p>
