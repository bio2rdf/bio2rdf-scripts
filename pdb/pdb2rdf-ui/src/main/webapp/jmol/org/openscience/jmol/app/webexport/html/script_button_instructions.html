      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The
ScriptButton Template
      </p>
      <p><a name="Description"></a>This tab is
designed to produce
a web page that displays a single Jmol applet alongside a
scrolling pane
containing Jmol script buttons. The buttons change what is
displayed in the Jmol applet. What the buttons do is defined by setting
up
Jmol
with the view you want the user to see. You can add explanatory text
using a standard web editor.&nbsp; This panel can be opened once
and
returned to anytime. An example picture of such a page is shown below:<br>
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 250px; height: 199px;" alt="picture of a Resizable web page" src="script_button.png"><a name="Page_Cartoon"></a></p>
      <p><a name="Instructions"></a><b><i>Instructions</i></b> </p>
      <p>1) Set the relative path to the Jmol applet on your web site from where
you
will put the folder (directory) containing the files created by this
program. (<a href="Path_to_Applet.html">more...</a>)</p>
      <p>2) Put your name(s) in the Author space. This will add you as
the
author
in the page meta data that is used for searching.</p>
      <p>3) Add the title you want to appear in the browser window
title bar.
This
does not have to be the same as the title you will use for the page.</p>
      <p>4) Set the percentage of the window width that you want Jmol
to
occupy.</p>
      <p>5)&nbsp;If not already done, open the first file you want to appear
in your
page using the File..Open.. menu in the Jmol viewer. If you will be
using
more than one model, open the models one at a time (occasionally you
might need to use "load
append" or the "append models" checkbox to allow displaying more than
one model simultaneously), and follow steps (6) &amp; (7) for each
individual view.</p>
      <p>6) Set the state of the model (zoom, rotate, select, change colors, add
orbitals, set the molecule spinning, etc.)exactly the way you want it
to
appear on the web page.</p>
      <p>7) Click on the "Add Present Jmol State as Instance" button.</p>
      <p>8) Repeat for as many different displays as you wish. A button will be
added
to the web page that will create each display when the user clicks the
button.
You do not need to load a new file each time if you are just modifying
the
way the previous one is displayed.</p>
      <p>9) When you are done, click on "Save HTML as..." Provide either the
name of a
new directory for this page or the name of the HTML file (.htm or
.html) you
want to create or replace. All necessary files will be created in the
same
directory. These include the HTML page itself, the JavaScript file
JmolPopin.js, and three files for each view: a data file, a Jmol
script, and
a PNG image. If a new directory is indicated, the HTML file will be
created
in that directory and have the same name, with ".html" appended.</p>
      <p>10) Open the HTML file in your favorite web editor and add your
explanatory
text and anything else you wish. As long as you do not alter the inside
of
the tables where Jmol and its buttons will be displayed, you should be
able to change
the
page without disrupting the JavaScript that controls the behavior of
Jmol. </p>
