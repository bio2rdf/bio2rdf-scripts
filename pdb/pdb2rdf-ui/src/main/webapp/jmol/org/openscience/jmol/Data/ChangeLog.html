      </ul>
      <h3>jmol-0.3</h3>
      <ul>
         <li> PhysicalProperties (Charges, NMRShieldings, Vectors,
              etc.) can be set by the file readers.  Christoph Steinbeck 
              asked for this originally when he wrote GaussianFile.  It was 
              a good idea, and was worth the extensive rewrite. (DG)
         </li>
         <li> Swing 1.1.1 Beta 1 (fixes some annoying bugs for Java 1.1 
              users) (DG)
         </li>
         <li> The GaussianFile class has been updated to read general 
              Gaussian files (not just G98) and to automatically compute 
              chemical shifts using stored ab initio values for 
              tetramethyl silane's chemical shift. (CS)
         </li>
         <li> Some bug fixes.(DG)</li>
         <li> Shaded bonds that look like cylinders.  Well, at least they look
              a little bit like cylinders. End caps would be a nice addition, but
              I've been a bit busy lately.(DG)
         </li>
         <li> FileTyper and ImageTyper accessories for JFileChooser make
              choosing file types more sensible than just using the filename
              filter.  These classes were rationalized after 0.2 had
              already been released.  They also listen to the JFileChooser
              to try to guess what kind of file you just selected (only
              if UseFileExtensions is set).(DG)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>jmol-0.2</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Many internal changes.</li>
         <li>Jmol has moved to a new home.  I've been working on a web
              site called "The OpenScience Project", and have registered a
              domain for it, so Jmol is the first of the software projects
              that is housed at www.openscience.org (DG)
         </li>
         <li> Christoph Steinbeck contributed a new input filter for
              Gaussian 98 log files, complete with a parser for NMR chemical
              shifts.(CS)
         </li>
         <li>The file readers now subclass a more general (but very
              simple) ChemFile class.  This should make addition of other file
              readers easier.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>File Type selection is no longer dependent on the file's
              extension.  You can select a "*.jnk" file and explicitly 
              tell Jmol what kind of file it is when opening the file. (DG)
         </li>
         <li>There is a strange interaction between fillPolygon in jdk1.2
              and the X server under Solaris x86.  (And circles under jdk1.2
              look lumpy on many architectures.)  I've built a workaround into
              Jmol which involves talking directly to the Graphics2D object
              underlying the display panel to set some Rendering hints.  This
              workaround has the benefit of making some really nice
              pictures when you want high quality (but lower speed).  If you
              have jdk1.2, turn on AntiAliasing in the Preferences to see the
              difference.  An unfortunate side effect is that you now need the
              jdk1.2 classes to compile (but not run) Jmol. (DG)
         </li>
         <li>A Jpeg encoder has been added. The JpegEncoder and its
              associated classes are Copyright (c) 1998, James R. Weeks and
              BioElectroMech.  This software is based in part on the work of
              the Independent JPEG Group.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>Build process now uses a Makefile.(DG)</li>
         <li>The Makefile now has the ability to create javadocs of 
              the source code.(HG)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>jmol-0.1.1</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Removed the extra double-buffering that resulted from not
              understanding that Swing components are automatically
              double-buffered. This resulted in substantial performance
              improvements.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>Fixed some depth strangeness in the drawn atom
              sizes.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>Fixed the bonds so that they render more realistically as
              the molecule is being rotated.  End caps for the bonds are
              still in progress.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>Reordered the toolbar buttons and added a button for
              molecule deformations that will eventually do something
              useful. (DG)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>jmol-0.1</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>There are some major new features, so the minor version number 
              has been incremented. (DG)
         </li>
         <li>Atom Types are now editable using "Atom Properties" in the
              Edit Menu.  This added a large chunk of interface code to do the
              JTable and cell editors and column sorters.  The edited atom
              types are saved in the .jmol directory under the user's home
              directory.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>The Preferences dialog now saves preference info in the 
              .jmol directory under the user's home directory.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>Reorganization of classes into a jar file.(DG)</li>
         <li>An atom selection mechanism now is working.(DG)</li>
         <li>Reorganization of source: BondTypeTable is gone, BondType is
              now replaced by Bond.  Many other changes for new
              AtomTypeTable. (DG)
         </li>
         <li>Silly little Splash screen, but it makes startup feel faster
              when there is something popped up on the screen almost
              immediately.
         </li>
         <li>There is now a "Front" item in the View menu.  The View 
              menu actions are not intuitive yet, so they will be changing 
              in a future version. Don't get used to them.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>There is a new "fast forward" button in the Animate dialog 
              that takes the animation to the last frame.(DG)
         </li>
         <li>The Rewind, FastForward, Next, and Previous buttons in the
              Animate dialog now stop the animation when they are pushed. 
              (DG)
         </li>
