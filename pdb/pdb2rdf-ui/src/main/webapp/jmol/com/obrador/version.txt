This is version 1.0a.  This version corrected the dirty edges of images whose
dimensions were not mutliples of 8.

Version 1.0 was a fix of the below bug but still had dirty edges in
non-multiple-of-8 dimension images.

Version 0.9 didn't flush the entropy encoder's buffer and
resulted in files that some viewers were unable to read.  This has been
fixed in version 1.0.
